# Title: Helium Coverage Accuracy Improvement

# Summary
No way currently exists for Helium hotspot operators to assert a non-standard antenna.  This creates a disincentive for hotspot owners to improve coverage, as non-standard (usually high gain) antennas can cause invalid witness transactions due to being "stronger" than the blockchain rules account for.  

This HIP presents a method that incentivizes HS owners to submit accurate information about the antenna they use in order to be accurately compensated for the coverage they provide.

# Motivation (use graphics!)
Current hotspot owners using antennas not provided by Helium run the risk of being penalized when they provide greater coverage with a higher gain antenna. This creates a disincentive to provide above-average coverage and puts a block in front of optimizing the network by restricting radiation power and patterns.

# Stakeholders
Both HS owners running standard antennas and HS owners running non-standard antennas are stakeholders.  HS owners with standard antennas will be rewarded based on the known characteristics of their antennas.  HS owners with aftermarket antennas can provide greater network coverage and receive greater rewards for doing so.
